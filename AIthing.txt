My conspect and also essay about AI and Devin after watching many videos on YouTube about unemployment and AI 
1. Tweet? Python, chatGPT, software engineer? 
Practical engineering passwed interviews 
2. Hiring dump? Do you need me sort algorithm? Bubble sort?
3. How many jobs they searched to be passed? Interesting question...
4. Humans do not know what they want, because devin is AI that understands straight while human language is curve kinda.
5. GIT: many resolved but is unassisted so 13% is poinless
SWE-Bench benchmark??? 
OPTIMIZATION <-> 
#AI itself is good, but not good enough!
Congratulations Devin! You are faster at googling than me.
You are spending time on coding, ui, and other things at takes too much time Devin!

#print for debugging 


AI is incredible goldrush now, and NFT is useless. 

SARA? well you are telling about generation? Well you are taking 40 minutes
